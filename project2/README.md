# PROJECT 2 

## Report:

This project was developed as part of the Information and Coding course, the first in a series of three practical assignments. 

The primary objective is to apply and deepen our understanding of fundamental concepts in digital signal processing, including sampling, quantization, and the representation of signals in both time and frequency domains. Additionally, the project integrates key principles of information theory-combinatorial, probabilistic, and algorithmic approaches to efficient information representation.

```
    Despite being a group of four, only three members contributed 
    to the project development. 
    Therefore we decide to maintain the original work distribution, 
    being each member responsible for one of the parts.

We all did one readme.md file

### README file structure:
- **Software installation commands**
- **Build and Run commands**
- **Commands explanation**
    - structure
    - examples
- **Relevant information**
    - task analyses
    - task results
    - task examples


>On the table bellow there a link for the `README` file for each of the parts.
