## BitStream


## Testing Bitstream

1. `Runing the encoder`:
```bash
./run_encoder.sh
```
- Then will appear the following prompt:
    ```
    Enter input text file path (containing 0s and 1s): <input.txt>
    Enter output binary file path: <output.bin>
    ```
    The value for binary file path is a sugestion

2. `Runing the decoder`:
```bash
./run_decoder.sh
```
- Then will appear the following prompt:
    ```
    Enter input binary file path: <output.bin>
    Enter output text file path (to reconstruct 0s and 1s): <decoded.txt>
    ```
    The values for output text file path is a sugestion
