# PROJECT 1 : Part III

### **1ยบ** OpenCv instalation

---
- macOs:
```
brew install opencv
```
---
- linux:
```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```
---
- win:
```
download from the website
```

---


### **2ยบ** SetUp enviroment
In order to be more easy to collaborating with others, as CMake will handle the build configuration across differents enviroments

- 2.1 : **Create a *CMakeLists.txt***
    - find the OpenCv library installed on system;
    - pointing automatically to the correct include;
    - include all the OpenCv libraries

    ```txt
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
    project(ImageDecoderProject)

    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

    # Check if std::filesystem requires linking with stdc++fs
    if (APPLE OR ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME} MATCHES "Linux")
        find_library(STD_FS_LIBRARY stdc++fs)
        if (STD_FS_LIBRARY)
            message(STATUS "Linking with stdc++fs")
            set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -lstdc++fs")
        endif()
    endif()

    # Find OpenCV package
    find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

    # Include OpenCV directories
    include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})

    # Add the executable
    add_executable(ImageDecoder partIII.cpp ImageDecoder.cpp)

    # Link OpenCV libraries
    target_link_libraries(ImageDecoder ${OpenCV_LIBS})
    ```

- 2.2 : **Build and Run**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./ImageDecoder
    ```
