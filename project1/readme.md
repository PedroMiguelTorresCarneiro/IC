### PART I : Text Data Manipulation

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **T1**| | **100%** |
| | Open and read a text file line by line or as a stream of characters | *Done* |
| | Store the content in a suitable data structure | *Done* |
| | Make sure the file opens successfully, and handle any errors | *Done* |
| | Print the content to check if it has been read correctly | *Done* |
| **T2**| | **100%** |
| | **Converting to lowercase:** This ensures that case differences donâ€™t affect the word counts | *Done* |
| | **Removing punctuation:** Punctuation marks are typically ignored when calculating word frequencies | *Done* |
| **T3**| | **75%** |
| | Iterate through the text and count how many times each character appears| *Done* |
| | Store the content in a suitable data structure | *Done* |
| | Print out the character frequencies | *Done* |
| | Although not mandatory, you can use a plotting library to visualize the frequencies |  |
| **T4**| | **75%** |
| | Tokenize the text into words using whitespace as the delimiter| *Done* |
| | Store the word counts | *Done* |
| | Print out the character frequencies | *Done* |
| | Although not mandatory, you can use a plotting library to visualize the frequencies |  |
| **Further Extensions**| | **50%** |
| | You can add functionality to handle different encodings (e.g., UTF-8) if working with non-ASCII characters|  |
| | Consider calculating the frequency of n-grams (bigrams, trigrams) for a more complex analysis. | *Done* |
| **Additional Resources**| | **0%** |
| | **Text Preprocessing Concepts:** Refer to resources on NLP (Natural Language Processing) for more advanced text manipulation techniques|  |



### PART III : Image Data Processing
Using Cmake to garantee that all colaborators have correct builds

| Task              | description     | status          |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **T1** | | **100%** |
|  | Load an image from a file | *DONE* |
| | Display the image using OpenCV functions | *DONE* |
| **T2** | | **100%** |
| | Split the RGB image into the corresponding three channels | *DONE* |
| | Convert the image from RGB to grayscale | *DONE* |
| | Display the color channels and grayscale image and compare it with the original color image | *DONE* |
| **T3** | | **100%** |
| | Calculate the histogram of pixel intensities for the grayscale image |*DONE* |
| | Visualize the histogram to analyse the distribution of intensity values | *DONE* |
| **T4** | | **100%** |
| | Apply a Gaussian blur filter to the image with different kernel sizes | *DONE* |
| | Display the blurred image and compare it with the original | *DONE* |
| **T5** | | **100%** |
| | Implement a function to calculate the absolute difference between two images | *DONE* |
| | Compute and display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the two images | *DONE* |
| | Display the difference image to visually observe where the differences are | *DONE* |
| **T6** | | **0%** |
| | Implement the quantization function on grayscale images | *DONE* |
| | Experiment with different numbers of quantization levels | *DONE* |
| | Compare the original image with the quantized one using MSE and PSNR to evaluate the quality | *DONE* |
