### PART III : Image Data Processing
Using Cmake to garantee that all colaborators have correct builds

| Task              | description     | status          |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **T1** | | > 100% |
|  | Load an image from a file | DONE |
| | Display the image using OpenCV functions | DONE |
| **T2** | | > 100% |
| | Split the RGB image into the corresponding three channels |DONE |
| | Convert the image from RGB to grayscale | DONE |
| | Display the color channels and grayscale image and compare it with the original color image | DONE |
| **T3** | | > 100% |
| | Calculate the histogram of pixel intensities for the grayscale image |DONE |
| | Visualize the histogram to analyse the distribution of intensity values | DONE |
| **T4** | | > 100% |
| | Apply a Gaussian blur filter to the image with different kernel sizes | DONE |
| | Display the blurred image and compare it with the original | DONE |
| **T5** | | > 0% |
